                    Bushfires is happening every year around Australia in different places. It causes to kill the native 
                    animals and people as well as some bush. Australia wild wide animals and plants are developed in the 
                    movement of bushfires. Indigenous people and environment accept this movement, but each bushfire is 
                    getting worth every time due climate change and unnecessary deforestation. A large bushfire can give 
                    a multiple impact to different industry. For example, decreasing of the rural population, smoke, 
                    water resources, environmental issues for the wild animals, and increase of government budget, 
                    insurance and other recovery costs.

                <p>
                    There are several possible reasons for the devastating fires in Australia. 
                    Firstly, and mainly weather condition on that year effect the size of bushfire especially little rain and dry. 
                    Australia is known as one of the dry places in the world. Country needs some rainfall through the year to keep 
                    away from the bushfires. Also, high temperature helped to fire. 
                    Secondly, trees that natively grown in Australia. Some of them especially eucalyptus produces highly volatile 
                    oils in its leaves and releases gases containing them into the air. 
                    Thirdly is caused by the human. Deforestation or arson become very popular factor to be fire on summer time.

                    As reactions from outside of Australia, there was also some overseas help. Few countries army and

                    There was the huge impact to the wild animals around Australia. The study, conducted by scientists from 
                    multiple universities, found wildlife including 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million 
                    birds and 51 million frogs. was damaged. Also, The prospects for the animals that survived the fires 
                    "would not be very good," as they lost food and habitat and were unable to protect themselves from predators, 
                    Chris Dickman said on his interview. Australian official said, "It's one of the worst wildlife disasters in 
                    modern history."

                <p>
                    The situation of the koalas are even worth than other animals. Nearly 8000 koalas have been killed due this bush 
                    fires. In Kangaroo Island in south Australia, more than half of habitat were burned and 80% of koalas have lost 
                    their home. 650 koalas had rescued, and island is now recovering to the new period.

                    However, there is some problem for the recovery and future. Bushfire is often happened in Australia, but 2019-2020 
                    bushfires were very massive and abrupt changes in very short term. This change may burn all seed or any other 
                    nutrition or the recovery. Also, animals lost their home. Previously, changes are not very quick, animals were able 
                    to find another place to stay to be away from fire and other natural enemy. But these days bushfire are not able to 
                    react the fire because all movement is very quick. Abrupt change is not the grate think in environment. This is the 
                    time for the world citizen to think about the climate change and earth environment to make the calm and peaceful 
                    earth.
